Day 1 completed July 7, 2018

Followed through the tutorial while individually learning the concepts presented by Wes.

After completion, I added functionality to allow user to click the cells to activate them.

I also added `user-select: none` to the `css` `html` selector to prevent users from highlighting the texts.
